The Jam language, an ML language implemented in Java, is designed by Mohamed Adam Chaieb, with the help of Prof. Brigitte Pientka's writings for the class CS 302: Programming Languages and Paradigms at McGill University. The aim for the language is to provide simple mathematical tools, augmented with the power of functional programming.
